1. Part one is finished. All the else if statements in ECommerceUserInterface has been implemented.
   All the code required for the 4 actions to theoretically work is there.

2. The cart class has only implemented 3 methods excluding the orderitems. The program cannot add, remove or print out the items that are
   suppose to be in the cart; however, these 3 methods are fully coded.
   The cartItem class is also implemented with references to the object Product and the string productOptions, these two instance variable
   has getters and setters as well.

3a. The 4 methods  (ADDTOCART, REMCARTITEM, PRINTCART, ORDERITEMS) all have code and comments in them that is intended for it to function properly.
    However, the program cannot add properly due to not having a proper implementation that adds items to the cart.

3b. All the errMsg variables and return types has been replaced and all the custom exception classes are fully built at the bottom of EcommerceSystem.

3d. The reading file function of the product.txt file is implemented as a private method. It is coded to read all the line sof the file and produce a book
